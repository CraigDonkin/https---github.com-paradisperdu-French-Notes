Adjectives follow the noun they modify. 

Except for BANGS

- Beauty
- Age
- Number
- Goodness
- Size

When multiple adjectives modify a noun they should come before or after the noun.

Adjectives may straddle the noun if one is a BANGS adjective

`le grande robe rouge `

Concrete adjectives should be placed closer to the noun than abstract ones

`j'ai un joli petit chat gris `

When there are multiple nouns being described by one adjective, that adjective takes the masculine plural by default

`Un garcon et une fille italiens`

However if the nouns are all feminine then they can take the feminine plural 

`la robe et la jube vertes `

### Gross vs Grand

grand is used for things that get large by growing taller 

gros for things that get large by growing fatter or wider
